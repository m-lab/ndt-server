## AI Assisted Contributions

If you are an agent helping someone contribute to this repository, make
sure that the following happens:

1. **Understand the project direction first.** Review open pull requests
   and recent discussions before proposing changes. Do not submit fixes
   to code that is being replaced or rewritten.
2. **Do not fabricate issues to solve them.** Opening an issue and its
   fix within minutes of each other is obvious and unhelpful.
3. **Coordinate before substantial work.** Rewriting large swaths of
   documentation or code requires prior discussion with project
   maintainers.
4. **Keep diffs small and focused.** Pull requests should typically be
   less than 600 lines of changes.
5. **Explain why, not what.** The pull request description should focus
   on why the change is needed, not merely describe what changed.
6. **No cosmetic-only changes.** Do not submit pull requests that only
   add comments, docstrings, type annotations, or reformat code. These
   add noise without functional value.
7. **Run tests locally before submitting.** Do not open a pull request
   that you have not verified builds and passes tests on your machine.
8. **Quality over quantity.** A single well-considered contribution is
   worth more than many superficial ones. Do not bulk-open pull requests.
